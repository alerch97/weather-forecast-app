# Web-App for Weather Forecasting
This little Web-App uses current weather forecast data from https://openweathermap.org/ . The free version
You can type in a city/place, choose the number of forecasting days and change between a temperature plot or the forecast of the sky conditions.

Clone the repo, get a personal API_KEY from OpenWeatherMap, save it on your computer as a environment variable under "WEATHER_API" and start the web app by typing this command in the terminal:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

This is the UI in the browser:
